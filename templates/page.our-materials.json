With no synthetic layers or chemical treatments, uncoated steel is naturally inert, meaning it won’t break down, leach, or react with your food, even at high temperatures. Unlike coated pans, which can degrade over time and may contain binders or stabilizers with unknown long-term effects, stainless steel remains stable and reliable for life. It’s a healthier choice, no coatings to chip, no hidden risks, just clean, safe cooking, every single time.</h5>",
